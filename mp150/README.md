MPy150
======

version 1.1.2 (05-Sep-2014)

**NOTE:** Because BIOPAC wasn't too thrilled about having mpdev.dll
online for free, it is not included with this library. You have to buy it.
And then you can add it to the MPy150 folder. Sorry.

All Python bits are developed by Edwin Dalmaijer. mpdev.dll (version 2.1) is a
proprietary library, created by [BIOPAC Systems, Inc.](http://www.biopac.com/)

MPy150 is open source software and therefore free to use and modify at will.
Warranty, however, is NOT given. If this software fails, causes your computer
to blow up, your spouse to leave you, your toilet to clog and/or the entire
supply of nuclear missles on earth to launch, or anything else that you might
want to blame on us, the author(s) CANNOT IN ANY WAY be held responsible.
